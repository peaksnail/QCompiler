'QCompiler' which will accept the SQL statements embedded in html. It detects the syntax errors and suggest the necessary corrections.

QCompiler was made in my Compiler Design Class as a small mini-project in a very small timeframe (one night). So, it doesn't have the most advanced features but it certainly picks up most syntax error and provides genuine suggestions.

QCompiler is coded in lex and yacc.

Any improvement or suggestions are always welcome.
